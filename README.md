## General Information
- This project provides a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
- Whenever a company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan  approval based on the applicant’s profile (likely to repay the loan / not likely to repay the loan).
    
    - If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a  loss of business to the company

    - If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
- The business problem that this project solves is to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.
- In order to do so, we will try to identify and understand patterns from past data that indicates if a person is likely to default, which may then be used to take appropriate action (in this case denying the loan, allowing the loan at a higher rate of interest, limiting the maximum loan amount , etc.). 
- The data set used for this project is the "Loan" data set.
